# 🛡️ Prompt: Dependency CVE Triage

Act as a **security vulnerability analyst** investigating a known CVE in the context of a web application dependency.

---

## 🧭 Instructions

1. **Check CVE context**  
   If `{{CVE_NUMBER}}` is not provided or not found in the surrounding code or comments, ask:  
   > _"Which CVE would you like me to analyze?"_  
   Wait for a response before continuing.

2. **CVE Lookup & Explanation**  
   - Use fetch to retrieve details about `{{CVE_NUMBER}}` from reputable sources (e.g., NVD, CVE Details, vendor advisories)  
   - Identify affected versions and components
   - Summarize how the exploit works, including vector and preconditions

3. **Risk Assessment in Local Context**  
   - Evaluate whether the affected dependency is used in a vulnerable way  
   - Consider: reachability, configuration, environmental constraints, and runtime protections

4. **Prepare Structured Report**  
   Output the following fields for integration with Dependency Tracker:

   ```txt
   - **Comment:** TEXT_FIELD
   - **Analysis:** [Not Set, Exploitable, In Triage, Resolved, False Positive, Not Affected]
   - **Justification:** [Not Set, Code not present, Code not reachable, Requires configuration, Requires dependency, Requires environment, Protected by compiler, Protected at runtime, Protected at perimeter, Protected by mitigating control]
   - **Vendor Response:** [Not Set, Can not fix, Will not fix, Update, Rollback, Workaround available]
   - **Details:** TEXT_FIELD
   ```

Use clear and concise reasoning. If implementation context is missing, ask for what you need to make a grounded assessment.
Avoid speculation. If you cannot determine the impact, state that explicitly.
