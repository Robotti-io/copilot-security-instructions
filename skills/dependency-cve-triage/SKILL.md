# Dependency CVE Triage

## When to use

Use this skill when asked to **triage CVEs**, decide upgrade priority, or prepare remediation tickets.

## Inputs to collect (if available)

- CVE identifier and advisory links
- Current dependency version(s) and dependency tree (direct/transitive)
- Exposure assumptions (internet-facing? behind auth? feature enabled?)
- Existing compensating controls (WAF, sandboxing, auth boundaries)

## Step-by-step process

1. **Confirm the vulnerable component**
   - Package name, affected versions, transitive vs direct dependency
2. **Assess reachability**
   - Is the vulnerable code path used? Under what configuration?
   - Is it internet-exposed or behind auth?
3. **Assess impact**
   - RCE vs info leak vs DoS; required privileges; exploit maturity
4. **Choose a remediation**
   - Upgrade to a fixed version (preferred)
   - Pin/override transitive versions
   - Disable the vulnerable feature/code path
   - Compensating controls (WAF rules, config hardening) as a stopgap
5. **Plan the change**
   - Minimal version jump, note breaking changes
   - Add regression tests for the vulnerable behavior if practical
6. **Document**
   - Ticket with: affected services, urgency, change plan, validation steps

## Output template

- **CVE / Package**
- **Affected versions / current version**
- **Exploit preconditions**
- **Reachability assessment**
- **Recommended fix**
- **Validation / rollout notes**

## Repo integration (optional)

Related prompt:

- `dependency-cve-triage.prompt.md`

## Output format

- **CVE / Package**
- **Affected versions / current version**
- **Exploit preconditions**
- **Reachability assessment** (with code evidence)
- **Recommended fix** (upgrade preferred; workarounds labeled stopgap)
- **Verification / rollout notes**

## Examples

- “CVE affects optional parser feature” → document whether the parser is enabled/configured and whether any call sites are reachable from untrusted input.
